title: Cyberpunk 2077 Review

**EDIT:** After finishing the game and spending over 100 hours in Night city, I have to say that my initial expectations were subverted by how excellent the main story is. The characters are incredibly well written and you can't help but get pulled into their struggles, especially with Panam and Johny. That said, the game is still buggy and the performance is nowhere near satisfactory, but I recommend that you give the game a try before giving your opinion.

Cyberpunk promised an immersive, futuristic city packed with interesting characters and stories, but instead, the game feels like nothing more than a mediocre clone of Grand Theft Auto with some pretty visuals (if on the [off chance](https://www.digitaltrends.com/computing/gpu-shortage-q3-2020-double-triple-price/) you got a GeForce 3000 series card). It saddens me to say this because I know, deep down under the pile of bugs and performance issues, there is an intriguing narrative just waiting to be told.

If The Last of Us 2 on Playstation 4 proved anything, it's that beautiful games can still run well even on 7-year-old hardware. Nowadays there are no excuses for bad performance, it all depends on how much care the developers put into optimizing the game. My PC was built to be top of the line 3 years ago, rocking an Intel i7-7700 and a GTX 1080. I've rarely had performance issues in games. EA's Battlefield 1 runs at a smooth 90 FPS at ultra settings on 1440p. It would be an understatement to say that Cyberpunk 2077 is unoptimized. The game becomes a slideshow even at medium settings, that along with the bullet-spongy enemies makes every shootout an excruciating experience.

Then there are the bugs, so many of them I can't keep count. At the start of the game, palm trees filled the bottom half of my screen because every palm tree in the city would clip through the building. At one point my car started ignoring collision physics, giving me the power to drive through oncoming traffic. Policemen would shoot me for no apparent reason, but when I commit a crime, all it takes is to drive 100 ft in a straight line because the police don't know how to drive. When the goal of the game is to convince a *choomba* that they live in a world 57 years into the future, any visual flaws will quickly undercut the immersion, not to mention game-breaking dialog problems.

I am never preordering a game again, I've learned from my mistake. There's nothing to do now but wait for CDPR to slowly row out performance patches and bug fixes. Who knows, maybe in a year the game will be everything it claims to be now. Perhaps there's nothing more cyberpunk than the launch itself - a soulless corporation forcing mandatory 12-hour workdays on engineers to deliver an unfinished product so they can squeeze some more *eddies* out of unaware consumers.
