<!--excerpt-->

Winning an argument on the internet is a little different than doing so in real life, mainly because it's online so you are limited to your keyboard, but on the plus side you won't get punched in the face by a victim of your online spew of abuse. These limitations automatically bring about some new rules into the fray and I suggest you get used to them, as there's nothing you can do about it other than hoping they are stupid enough to accept virus_of_doom.exe over messenger.

**Part 1: Don't Care.** It sounds obvious but if you don't care you won't be able to lose an argument, simple as that. If somebody starts one with you then they are obviously angry about something. Keep it that way. As soon as you begin to care, the balance of power shifts and your chances of winning decrease dramatically. Imagine arguing with something that doesn't care, such as a wall. You can't win as there's nothing to argue with.

**Part 2: Karma.** If you are unaware of the concept, karma balances everything out. If you're happy now, you will be unhappy later. This pretty much applies to everything in life. What's this got to do with arguments? Well, I'm gonna exploit karma and think of an argument as having a neutral outcome where the sum of the emotions of the 2 people arguing cancels each other out. Basically, the happier you are, the less happy they are. Does it work? Yes, if you think it does. It's all psychological, remember? Those people on the internet are not real people, afterall.

**Part 3: Turn to Your Advantage.** If they started the argument, you already have the upper hand in that you can simply not care and nothing will happen. If you started the argument and they are trying to ignore you, I suggest super harsh tactics to get them to argue. Perhaps you start talking to them and act really friendly, when they trust you and seem like they really regret arguing with you, you can suddenly say something really horrible to them; This will catch them totally off-guard and will make them angry because of it. Yeah, it's really horrible to do it to them but remember that they'd do the same to you if they have the chance, especially now.

**Part 4: Act Stupid.** When the other person is really passionate in an argument, stringing together paragraphs of fantastic arguments you can't possibly compete with, a short and simple comment will send the ball back into their court, wasting their time and their 2 page long argument. You may feel childish or immature, but this breaks the flow of conversation, knocks them off guard, and makes them have to resort to something equally immature if they want to win. If they care enough to do something like that to you, just don't care and they'll eventually go insane.

**Part 5: Weaknesses.** Understanding their weaknesses is obviously important and finding one will strengthen your position to win, but understanding your own weaknesses is even more important. You could of course use your weaknesses to your advantage, possibly generating fake ones for them to discover and attempt to breakthrough. Pretend to be really upset if they diss somebody in your family, or pretend you are a 3 foot tall sales assistant, the stupider the better. Watching them use it against you will make you feel super clever for leading them down a dead end. Tell them "I actually lied about that" at the end for extra credit.

**Part 6: Winning an Argument.** When they start sending you paragraphs of angry messages, you've won (see above). Other ways of telling that you've won are if they say their friends are going to hack your PC, or if they start spamming you with a flood of identical messages. For this I suggest going off for half an hour or so. When you come back, they will probably have given up and said something along the lines of "haha i win" before going offline and blocking you. Don't go after them to tell them they haven't actually won, that would be exactly what they want. Remember, they are probably sitting in their rooms right now thinking of ways of killing you. Well done! You've won an argument, save the conversation in Notepad for future reference.
